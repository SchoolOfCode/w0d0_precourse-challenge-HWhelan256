    <h2 id="headline">Here's a timeline of Phyllis "Pippa" Latour Doyle's life:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1921</strong> - Born in South Africa to Louise and Philippe, a French doctor. Philippe died shortly after Phyllis' birth.</li>
      <li><strong>1924</strong> - Phyllis' mother remarried a racing driver, then died in a crash. Phyllis was orphaned and went to live with relatives in French Equatorial Africa.</li>
      <li><strong>1939</strong> - At age 18 she headed to complete her education in Europe. </li>
      <li><strong>1941</strong> - Joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) as a flight mechanic but owing to her fluency in French was approached by SOE in 1942, to become an operative in France. She started an intensive training program to learn encryption, surveillance, and required physical skills such as climbing over roofs, parachuting etc.</li>
      <li><strong>1942</strong> - Phyliis eployed to Aquitaine in Vichy France where she worked for a year as a spy using the codename Genevieve. </li>
      <li><strong>1944</strong> - She parachuted into the Calvados area of Normandy, undercover as a 14 year old school girl "Paulette" living in the countryside with family to escape Allied bombing. Over this time she cycled around the countryside selling soaps to mostly German solders and talking to them, then transmitting 135 messages to Allied Command. She carried knitting with her everywhere, and encoded her messages on a piece of silk, which was then wrapped around a knitting needle, put into a flat shoe lace and used to tie up her hair.</li>
      <li><strong>After World War II</strong> - Married an Australian engineer, Patrick Doyle, and raised a family while living in Kenya, Fiji and Australia. Following a divorse, she finally settled in New Zealand, and didn't tell her children about her past. They discovered it 2000 via the internet!</li>
      <li><strong>2014</strong> - Phyllis was awarded the Legion of Honour, France's highest military honour, by the French government, as part of the 70th anniversary of the battle of Normandy.</li>
      <li><strong>2021</strong> - "Pippa" celebrated her 100th birthday. She is the last survivor of SOE's 40 female agents to be deployed to France, 13 of whom died by execution or in a concentration camp.</li>
