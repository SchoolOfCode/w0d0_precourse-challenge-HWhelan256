# Read Me

I chose this subject for my Tribute Page as I've been a Knitter for many years, and found it fascinating that the hobby was used as a communication method for spies during wartime. In addition Phyllis is an excellent example of an amazing female role model. 

My time during the pre-course has been **extremely** limited, due to work, kids, and a house move, and building this page has made me realise I will need a lot of practise to grasp the use of flex, and I got stuck trying to make layout adjustments. However it was a good grounding in HTML and CSS.
